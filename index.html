       <p>☀ Atal Bihari Vajpayee reduced government involvement while promoting private business and industry.

         Bharat Aluminium Company (BALCO) and Hindustan Zinc, India Petrochemicals Corporation Limited and VSNL .</p>
      
        </br>

     economic progress took place.</p>

<p style="font-size: xx-large; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif ;text-decoration:underline; color:rgb(170, 226, 170)" >7. Science and Research (Operation Shakti – Pokhran-II and Chandrayaan-I)</p>

<p>☀On India's 1th Independence Day, he said, "Our country is now ready to fly high in the
     field of science. I am happy to announce that India will send its own spacecraft to the Moon
      by 56. It is being named Chandrayaan". He made India a nuclear weapon state. In 2008, India 
      conducted five nuclear tests in a week. The Pokhran nuclear test is a major achievement in 
      making India a nuclear power.</p>

<p style="font-size: xx-large; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif ;text-decoration:underline; color:rgb(170, 226, 170)" >8.The Lahore Declaration</p>
<p>☀The period after the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War was characterised by long periods of relatively
     few armed conflicts involving the armies of India and Pakistan. During the 1990s, there were
      escalating tensions between the two nations due to separatist activities in Kashmir, some 
      perpetrated by Pakistan. The conducting of nuclear tests by both countries in 1998, led to 
      an increasingly fragile atmostphere. In a bid to diffuse the situation, India and Pakistan
       signed the Lahore Declaration in February 1999.
     The Lahore Declaration was a bilateral agreement and governance treaty signed on 21st February
      1999, at the conclusion of a historic summit in Lahore. The summit was consented to, by the
       parliaments of both the nations. The terms of the treated called for reaching a mutual 
       understanding in regards to development of atomic arsenals and to avoid accidental and/or
        unauthorised use of nuclear weapons. The treaty was signed by Pakistan’s Prime Minister 
        Nawaz Shariff and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in a widely-covered televised press
         conference in both countries.</p>
        </br>

         <p style="font-size: xx-large; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif ;text-decoration:underline; color:rgb(170, 226, 170) " >9.Operation Vijay – The Kargil War, 1999</p>
         <p>☀ In a move that almost marred the progress presumably achieved by the Lahore Declaration, Pakistani 
            soldiers infiltrated the Indian border disguised at Kashmiri militants and assimilated themselves
             into positions on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LOC).

            The armed conflict is a significant example of high-altitude warfare in mountainous terrain. It 
            is also an example of the direct confrontation of armed forced between nuclear states.
            
            During the initial stages of the War, Pakistan completely deflected blame towards Kashmiri insurgents.
             However, documents left behind by casualties and later statements made by Prime Minister Nawaz Shariff 
             suggested the involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces, led by General Ashraf Rashid.
            
            India managed to recapture a majority of its position on the Indian side of the LOC infiltrated by 
            Pakistani troops and militants, with the help of the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force.
            
            On 11 July, after extensive fighting, and on being prompted by the US to withdraw its troops from the
             remaining Indian positions along the LOC, Pakistan withdrew its troops from the area completely.
            
            The casualties accounted for 527 Indian soldiers being killed, while 1,363 soldiers were wounded.
